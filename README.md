As for the final phase of my internship in Elevate Labs, I have completed two projects from the given list of projects.

Project 1 - Secure File Storage System with AES.
ðŸ“Œ Description
      A web application that enables secure encryption and decryption of files using AES-256 encryption. Users can upload files, encrypt them, and download them securely.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Backend: Python, Flask
    - Libraries:
      - `cryptography` â€“ AES encryption and key handling
      - `hashlib` â€“ SHA256 hash for integrity checks
    - Output:
      - Encrypted files with `.enc` extension

âœ… Features
    - Upload, encrypt, and download files securely
    - Decrypt files only with the correct key
    - Store and verify file metadata:
      - Original filename
      - Timestamp
      - SHA256 hash
    - Tamper detection using hash comparison
    - Responsive dark-themed UI
      - Button highlighting on hover
      - Auto-resizing elements

Project 2 - Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator.
ðŸ“Œ Description
      A web app that evaluates password strength and shows how attackers can create custom wordlists using personal data. It helps users understand password vulnerabilities and improve password hygiene.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Backend: Python, Flask
    - Libraries:
      - `zxcvbn` â€“ Password strength scoring
      - `itertools`, `re` â€“ For pattern generation
    - Output:
      - Downloadable `.txt` wordlist

âœ… Features
